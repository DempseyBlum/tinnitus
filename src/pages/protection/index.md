      The aging process causes a natural hearing decline in almost everyone,
      particularly those living in a westernised society with its many sounds
      that are heard each day such as machinery, cars, television etc.


      This decline in our ability to clearly hear affects mainly high pitched
      sounds such as children's voices, rustling leaves and some musical
      instruments.


      Although 'age effect' hearing loss up through the age of 60 does not
      usually impair one's ability to hear and understand speech, problems occur
      when noise induced loss is added to the age loss. With noise damage, even
      a thirty year old can have trouble listening when background sound is
      present, such as in restaurants or crowded social environments.




      **You do not 'get used to noise'**


      Noise does not have to be uncomfortably loud to be damaging. You may even
      think that after working or living with a certain level of sound, your
      ears are 'used to it', but what has happened is that hearing loss has
      already begun. How quickly hearing loss takes place depends on the
      intensity of the noise, its duration and how often the exposure occurs.


      When you need to shout to be heard when you are one meter away, the noise
      levels are probably above 85dBA and hearing protection is recommended.




      **Noise damage indicators**


      If sounds seem muffled or softer after noise exposure, your hearing has
      been affected by a temporary threshold shift, which warns that your
      hearing has been overexposed. If you repeatedly do this without
      protection, the shift can become permanent and untreatable.


      For those of us with tinnitus, even temporary exposure to loud sounds can
      be the equivalent of 'sunburn of the hairs in the cochlear'. This means
      that your tinnitus will be elevated either for a short time (minutes to
      weeks) or result in a permanent elevation of your tinnitus level. It is
      critical that you protect your hearing whenever you are doing anything
      that exposes your ears to any sound louder than a domestic vacuum cleaner.

      Loud noise will exacerbate tinnitus. Ear muffs or ear-plugs should be worn
      when activities such as mowing the lawn or using a chainsaw are
      undertaken. Venues such as nightclubs or entertainment venues that have
      excessively loud noise should be avoided or ear protection used. If you
      have to shout to make yourself heard by someone standing within 1 to 1.5
      meters of you, the noise level is considered excessive and it will
      exacerbate your tinnitus.


      The diagram below illustrates the noise levels and corresponding lengths
      of exposure at which damage to the auditory system can occur.

      There are 4 main types of hearing protection, they are: Formable Plugs,
      Premolded Plugs, Semi-aural Devices and Ear Muffs. When selecting any
      hearing protection device, make sure you purchase quality products only;
      selecting something on price alone could cost you your hearing. It is best
      to purchase these types of products from an industrial safety supplier
      where you can get quality products and expert advice.


      They are listed in the yellow pages under that classification and
      available in most metropolitan and country regions.


      Always check the dBA rating of hearing protection products. As sound is
      measured logarithmically, be aware that when comparing two products of
      say, 30dBA and 33dBA, that the 33dBA product is not just ten percent
      better than the 30dBA product, it is twice as effective. Most earplugs are
      about 25 dBA and good ear muffs start at about 28dBA and go up to 34dBA. A
      good practice is to have a couple of pairs of disposable ear plugs in your
      car / handbag as well as at home and at least one pair of ear muffs where
      you would normally expose yourself to loud noise such as in the garage.
      Good quality hearing protection devices allow you to hear conversation
      around you, but cut out the harmful peaks of sound.




      **Fitting Hearing Protection**


      For hearing protection devices to be effective, they must fit correctly
      and be worn correctly, i.e. formable plugs must expand to fully block the
      ear canal and must be in the ear and not just sitting on the outside.


      To correctly insert earplugs, slowly roll and compress the plug into a
      thin cylinder or to the shape of a golf tee without inducing creasing.
      While the plugs are compressed, insert it well into the ear canal and hold
      it there while it begins to expand.


      Fitting is easier if you reach around the head and pull the ear outward
      and upward during insertion. Some earplugs can be washed in warm soapy
      water and reused, however do not re-use plugs that are cracked, hard or do
      not readily expand to their original size. If the plug bends, creases or
      deforms during insertion, remove it, reform it and then re-insert it. When
      fitted correctly, the outer edge of the earplug should be flush with or
      slightly inside the Tragus with at least half of the plug being inside the
      ear canal.


      A rough test of whether an earplug is inserted correctly can be applied by
      cupping your hands over your ears while listening to a steady noise. If
      the plugs are fitted correctly, the noise levels should be almost the same
      whether or not you are covering your ears.


      Earmuffs must fully enclose the ears and seal against the head. Adjust the
      headband so that the cushions exert an even pressure around the ears
      making sure that hair is pulled back from under the cushions.


      If you wear glasses, make sure that you choose earmuffs that have deep
      soft cushions that will mold around the stem of the glasses to form a firm
      fit against your head.

      **At What Noise Level Should I Use Hearing Protection?**


      As a guide, a motor mower is about 80dBA and this is about the threshold
      above which a person with no auditory problems must protect themselves,
      particularly as the duration of the exposure lengthens. The higher the
      level of sound, the shorter the time that you can be exposed before damage
      occurs. The chart in appendix 6 shows the relationship between the level
      of sound and the maximum allowable exposure for someone without any
      auditory problems or tinnitus. This should be taken as a guide only and
      someone who has tinnitus should always protect themselves from sounds of
      80 - 85dBA or above.


      It is better to err on the side of safety and protect your ears in all
      situations that you think may exacerbate your tinnitus; such as using a
      power tool, hammer, mowing the lawn, a noisy vacuum cleaner etc. The few
      seconds that it may take to put on a set of ear muffs may save you many
      hours of discomfort.
