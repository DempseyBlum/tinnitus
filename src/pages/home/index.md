  introBody: >-
    Tinnitus is a common condition that refers to a range of sounds or 'head
    noises' such as ringing, hissing, buzzing or clicking. There is no cure for
    tinnitus, but with appropriate support the condition can be successfully
    managed so that it has little or no impact on a person's life.
