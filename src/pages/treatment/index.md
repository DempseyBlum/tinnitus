      The support of family, friends and colleagues is crucial, especially in
      the early stages of tinnitus. People who trivialise the problem or who
      show little understanding can have a devastating effect on someone who is
      experiencing difficulty in coping with everyday life.


      The following suggestions will enable family and friends to offer
      constructive support.


      Tinnitus Spouse Survival


      Terri Nagler R.N.




      Day 1:


      'You know, my ears are ringing.'


      'Really? Both of them?'


      'Yeah.'


      'Hmm. Maybe it was the red wine. It always makes me feel stuffy.'




      Day 2:


      'I still have that buzzing in my head today.'


      'Hmm, maybe it was the curry - or the pollen.'


      'Yeah, maybe. Hope it's the pollen, I'll never give up Thai food!'




      Day 3:


      The noise is pretty loud now.'


      'Hmm, maybe it's the Relafen. I think tinnitus is a possible side effect
      of non-steroidals' 'Yeah, I think I'll stop it.'




      Four months and thousands of miles, dollars and prayers later my husband,
      Stephen, and I started to come to grips with the fact that an unwelcome
      visitor had taken up residence in his head and in our home. We eliminated
      the possible offenders: alcohol, caffeine, spices, herbs, medications. We
      blamed everything from the leaf blower to rock concerts. We sought help
      and advice from a score of specialists - from internist to acupuncturist.
      Every physiological and psychological cause was explored. We had the
      ultimate good news/bad news diagnosis - tinnitus. 'It won't kill you, but
      at times you just might want to kill yourself, one noted specialist
      concluded our unsuccessful visit to his clinic with. 'You've got a
      beautiful family and a lot to live for. Go home and get on with your
      life.' Easier said than done.




      Over the ensuing months, Stephen suffered a host of psychological and
      physical symptoms related to this severe intrusive tinnitus including
      profound depression, a 30-pound weight loss, insomnia, overwhelming
      nausea, bruxism (teeth grinding), fearfulness, increasing inability to
      function at work, and an uncertainty that fuelled his sense of despair
      about himself and his future. As spouses, we must appreciate the real
      physical and psychological toll that tinnitus takes on those who have it.
      Tinnitus is invisible - no cast, no limp, no cough, no definitive way to
      measure its presence or severity. This left my husband with the added
      burden of continually explaining his head noise, defending his sanity, and
      justifying his misery.




      As a nurse, I understood the impact that tinnitus was having on Stephen.
      It is much the same with any life-altering illness or injury. However, I
      found myself becoming impatient, weary, and annoyed with the incessant
      questions, our redundant conversation, and his constant need for
      reassurance. At one point I actually thought, 'How bad can this really
      be?' I decided to find out. 'I placed a portable radio in a purse with a
      shoulder strap. It was 'tuned' to white noise - the static between FM
      radio stations - at the level of loudness that roughly matched his
      tinnitus. Then I carried it around with me as I performed several routine
      household functions. Within thirty minutes I noticed that I was clenching
      my teeth and feeling irritable. After an hour, I turned the !%?$# thing
      off and tended to my full-blown headache. It's easy to become a bit blase
      about their suffering when they look so normal. But imagine what it would
      be like if you had to endure a screaming vacuum, siren, or kettle
      following you from room to room. Could you think creatively, make critical
      decisions, do anything substantive in an atmosphere of unabated noise?

      How would the loss of silence and its uncertain return affect your day,
      your work, your relationships and your life? The importance of supportive
      human contact cannot be overemphasized.




      Meeting his or her psychological needs may be the greatest challenge for
      the spouse. I personally focused on three areas that I felt complicated my
      husband's recovery and affected our family life.




      First, I redirected what I viewed to be faulty or distorted thinking.
      Cries of 'I can't get out of bed. My ears ring all the time! I'm useless,
      I can't do anything!' were met with reality-charged responses like, I'm
      changing the sheets, NOW! You seemed to enjoy watching the Braves last
      night. You can feed the cat and drive carpool' When I heard, I don't think
      that I'll ever get better!' I pointed out what he did accomplish while
      reminding him that there was no finite time line for recovery and that we
      would continue to work towards resolution.




      'Second, I sought to combat his inertia by encouraging simple, purposeful
      tasks that could be achieved within the framework of his shortened
      attention span. These included short-term community projects as well as
      household chores. Several times each week I insisted that he join me for a
      simple outing- a trip to the park or the bookstore - to break his routine
      and demonstrate that he could 'do something.' Third, I found it necessary
      to set some limits with regard to the discussion of tinnitus. While he was
      consumed with every facet of it, I still needed to attend to many other
      aspects of our daily life and it was not always convenient to stop
      mid-stream to chat or listen - again. Devoting a specific time to talk
      about tinnitus allowed me to listen without distraction, and it let him
      know that he had my undivided attention to express the anger, fear, and
      isolation that he felt.




      Over time, I compiled a list of 'Tinnitus Spouse Survival Tips' that are
      based on my not-so-scientific research with a patient population of one.
      They are, however, the result of my objective observations as a nurse and
      my subjective experience as a wife. I hope that the reader might find
      value in them as well.




      * Learn as much about tinnitus as possible. Take notes and ask questions.
      Become your spouse's medical liaison and advocate.

      * Don't underestimate the value of good psychiatric or psychological
      intervention for your spouse and for you.

      * Challenge distorted thoughts. Accentuate what is positive, and
      acknowledge but redirect negative thinking.

      * Get your spouse moving. Exercise, outings, and chores will build a
      resume of success that you can use to fight feelings of worthlessness.

      * Decrease as much extraneous stress in your lives as possible. (This may
      not be the year to make quilts for everyone on your Christmas list.)

      * Be compassionate and commiserate on occasion, but be tough when there is
      too much whining.

      * Be patient. Successful treatment is probable but this is not strep
      throat! No 10-day course of Amoxil here.

      * Maintain your social contacts and outside interests. Without any
      personal outlet you will become less effective in your supportive role.

      * Keep yourself physically and emotionally fit. Your spouse and your
      family need you and you deserve it!

      No specific drugs for treatment of chronic tinnitus that are both
      frequently effective and non-toxic have yet been developed, but research
      continues. On the other hand, sedatives, anxiolytics or anti-depressants
      are quite often needed for treating the background state of the patient.
      Such drugs without counselling are rarely going to be effective though.

      One of the first things to consider is whether to fit a hearing aid or
      aids, or improve or extend an existing fitting. Rather smaller than usual
      degrees of hearing loss can usefully be aided and thereby help the
      tinnitus also, especially if explained to the patient that it is a
      treatment for the tinnitus as well.


      To this end, the patient's acoustic environment should also be enriched,
      particularly at the quietest times, by addition of background noise at a
      level that becomes clearly audible when amplified by the hearing aid.
      Where possible and appropriate, fittings should be non-occluding and
      binaural. Poor hearing-aid fittings can lead to frustration, loudness
      discomfort and anxiety, and thus are liable to make tinnitus worse.

      'Tinnitus maskers', in their original usage, have proved disappointing in
      perhaps half of those treated in this way. Moreover complete masking,
      better described as suppression, may inhibit the process of habituation.


      Nevertheless, some patients still find a white noise generator (WNG)
      useful as a masker to provide temporary symptomatic relief, i.e. comfort
      while the masking effect is taking place.

      Dietary regimes are occasionally helpful. This should start with careful
      questioning to detect possible tinnitogenic dietary components (e.g.
      caffeine), drinks or medication, and be followed by dietary exclusion
      trials to confirm or disprove the potential benefits for that individual.
      Do not become obsessed with diet. If you enjoy a particular food and you
      find it gives your tinnitus a temporary increase, IT IS JUST TEMPORARY! So
      enjoy that glass of red wine, that piece of chocolate or that coffee with
      the knowledge that your tinnitus will settle down in time - it is all
      about quality of life!

      Hypnotherapeutic techniques can be of indirect help, by aiding relaxation.
      Methods of alternative medicine, including acupuncture and herbal
      preparations, only rarely seem to have any beneficial effect on tinnitus,
      but can be of worthwhile supportive value if the patient believes they are
      helping.

      Professor P. Jastreboff and Dr. J.Hazell developed Tinnitus Retraining
      Therapy (TRT). They believe that if a sensory system is repeatedly exposed
      to a non-threatening stimulus, the system will eventually habituate to it.
      There are two components to TRT:


      * Providing counselling so that the patient is not afraid of the tinnitus,
      and

      * Exposing the patient to low levels of background noise. It is believed
      that the low levels of background noise facilitate the habituation
      process.




      This procedure is not without controversy. It has been widely criticised
      for its lack of supporting data, its apparent disregard of widely held
      psychological principles, and the manner in which it has been promoted.

      Chasing cures for tinnitus is counter-productive as it encourages you to
      focus on your tinnitus. There is no cure for tinnitus at this point in
      time. It is better to learn to manage it so that it has little or no
      effect on your quality of life.
