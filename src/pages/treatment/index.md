      No specific drugs for treatment of chronic tinnitus that are both
      frequently effective and non-toxic have yet been developed, but research
      continues. On the other hand, sedatives, anxiolytics or anti-depressants
      are quite often needed for treating the background state of the patient.
      Such drugs without counselling are rarely going to be effective though.

      One of the first things to consider is whether to fit a hearing aid or
      aids, or improve or extend an existing fitting. Rather smaller than usual
      degrees of hearing loss can usefully be aided and thereby help the
      tinnitus also, especially if explained to the patient that it is a
      treatment for the tinnitus as well.


      To this end, the patient's acoustic environment should also be enriched,
      particularly at the quietest times, by addition of background noise at a
      level that becomes clearly audible when amplified by the hearing aid.
      Where possible and appropriate, fittings should be non-occluding and
      binaural. Poor hearing-aid fittings can lead to frustration, loudness
      discomfort and anxiety, and thus are liable to make tinnitus worse.

      'Tinnitus maskers', in their original usage, have proved disappointing in
      perhaps half of those treated in this way. Moreover complete masking,
      better described as suppression, may inhibit the process of habituation.


      Nevertheless, some patients still find a white noise generator (WNG)
      useful as a masker to provide temporary symptomatic relief, i.e. comfort
      while the masking effect is taking place.

      Dietary regimes are occasionally helpful. This should start with careful
      questioning to detect possible tinnitogenic dietary components (e.g.
      caffeine), drinks or medication, and be followed by dietary exclusion
      trials to confirm or disprove the potential benefits for that individual.
      Do not become obsessed with diet. If you enjoy a particular food and you
      find it gives your tinnitus a temporary increase, IT IS JUST TEMPORARY! So
      enjoy that glass of red wine, that piece of chocolate or that coffee with
      the knowledge that your tinnitus will settle down in time - it is all
      about quality of life!

      Hypnotherapeutic techniques can be of indirect help, by aiding relaxation.
      Methods of alternative medicine, including acupuncture and herbal
      preparations, only rarely seem to have any beneficial effect on tinnitus,
      but can be of worthwhile supportive value if the patient believes they are
      helping.

      Professor P. Jastreboff and Dr. J.Hazell developed Tinnitus Retraining
      Therapy (TRT). They believe that if a sensory system is repeatedly exposed
      to a non-threatening stimulus, the system will eventually habituate to it.
      There are two components to TRT:


      * Providing counselling so that the patient is not afraid of the tinnitus,
      and

      * Exposing the patient to low levels of background noise. It is believed
      that the low levels of background noise facilitate the habituation
      process.




      This procedure is not without controversy. It has been widely criticised
      for its lack of supporting data, its apparent disregard of widely held
      psychological principles, and the manner in which it has been promoted.

      Chasing cures for tinnitus is counter-productive as it encourages you to
      focus on your tinnitus. There is no cure for tinnitus at this point in
      time. It is better to learn to manage it so that it has little or no
      effect on your quality of life.
