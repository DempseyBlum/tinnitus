      From our earliest age our brain takes in sounds and classifies them
      according to whether they are threatening, neutral or non-threatening
      sounds. When the conscious mind classifies these sounds, the sub conscious
      mind has an automatic reaction to the sound the next time it is heard.
      This pattern will continue unless the conscious mind re-classifies the
      sound.




      When the conscious mind first hears tinnitus, it cannot correlate the
      sound with anything that it has heard, so our survival instincts means the
      brain will classify it as possibly threatening and will place the body and
      mind in a state of high alert for possible 'fight or flight'.




      If a person's initial reaction to the sound of their tinnitus is negative
      i.e. they are worried and fearful of the sound, a vicious cycle as shown
      below is established. This cycle can only be broken by addressing and
      overcoming one's fears.




      ![Graph showing how negative perception effects
      stress](/img/visciouscycle.gif "Vicious Cycle of Perception Char")




      **The way you think about a situation determines your emotional and
      physical reaction.**




      The following story from Dr Lawrence McKenna a UK psychologist illustrates
      the point.




      Pretend that you don't have tinnitus, and you're in a subway in New York
      jammed in like sardines, and some idiot comes up behind you, and starts
      jabbing you in the back with an umbrella. What happens?




      Well, if you're normal, you get upset, and you get mad. Your face gets
      red, your blood pressure goes up, and your pulse goes up. Those are
      physical changes in you based on the thought of the jerk who's stabbing
      you in the back with an umbrella. You turn around to tell him to stop, and
      you discover that it's not an umbrella, it's a gun. What happens?




      Your face goes pale, your palms get moist, your mouth gets dry. Those are
      physical changes in you based upon your thoughts about the stimulus - the
      very same stimulus, a poke in the back. So you turn around to give the guy
      all your money and you discover that it is not a gun. It's a blind lady
      with a cane trying to maintain her balance in this precarious situation.
      What happens?




      The colour returns to your face, a shudder of compassion comes over you,
      maybe a tear comes to your eyes. You try to assist her to a safe place in
      the subway. Again a different set of physical findings based upon your
      thoughts about the stimulus. So what's our stimulus? Our stimulus is our
      tinnitus. Changing the thoughts that we have about our tinnitus can not
      only impact on us philosophically, it can impact on us physically.




      Another example of your thoughts determining your emotional reaction to a
      situation is to imagine that three people were retrenched from their jobs.




      The first person thinks 'I am a Failure' , their emotional reaction is one
      of despair, anger, frustration and depression.




      The second person's thoughts are neutral, they therefore have no emotional
      reaction.


      The third person's thoughts are positive, 'I will take my payout and start
      that small business I have always wanted' , their emotional reaction is
      one of joy, hope, excitement and happiness.




      Each person was faced with the same situation, but because each person
      perceived their situation in a different way, they had a different
      emotional reaction.




      When you apply this philosophy to our situation of having tinnitus.....




      If your perception is negative, your emotional reaction will be one of
      despair, anxiety and depression. If your perception is neutral, 'It is
      difficult but I can cope' , you will have no emotional response.




      However if your perception is positive, 'I will manage it and not let it
      affect my life', your emotional reaction will be one of control, optimism
      and acceptance



       

      When a sound is threatening or unknown, the subconscious mind puts the
      brain and body into the 'fight or flight' survival mode.




      The following story from a paper presented by Dr. Stephen Nagler at a
      tinnitus seminar illustrates why a negative perception of tinnitus causes
      so much anxiety:




      (Dr. Nagler is a past Chairman of the Board of Directors of the American
      Tinnitus Association and for seven years served on ATA's Scientific
      Advisory Committee)




      There is a travelling salesman making several stops during a cold winter.
      He is chilly, tired, and hungry, but he has forgotten to make a motel
      reservation. He sees a motel by the side of the road. One level.




      Park right outside your room. Vacancy light flashing. The manager says
      that there is one room left, but unfortunately the steam radiator has a
      small crack in it; there is a constant 'hsssss' sound as steam escapes.




      The salesman is cold, tired and hungry, and takes the room gratefully. He
      enters the room, notices the quiet 'hsssss' sound and puts down his bags,
      eats a sandwich, brushes his teeth, takes a nice hot shower, puts on his
      pyjamas, pulls back the fresh linen on the bed, crawls in, and falls
      asleep.




      The next morning he awakes refreshed, and goes on his way. Six weeks later
      he finds himself in the same situation. Same town. Cold, tired, hungry. No
      reservation. He remembers the motel. The manager says, 'I have one room
      left. It's the same room you had six weeks ago, and I apologise: I have
      not yet had a chance to fix the steam radiator.' The salesman says 'No
      problem. I slept just great six weeks ago. I'll take it'.




      As he is walking down towards the room, the hotel manager yells to him,
      'Oh yes, one other thing. A couple of days ago a travelling circus came
      through our small town here, and two cobras escaped from the snake
      charmer. They caught one of them right there - about twenty yards up the
      street. And they expect to catch the other one any time now. Thought you'd
      like to know. Have a good night's sleep'.




      The salesman enters his room. He hears it. 'Hsssss' He looks carefully
      behind the curtain. Then he gets ready for that nice hot shower, but he
      slowly peeks into the shower before taking a quick shower. He then gets
      ready for bed. He looks under the bed first. He pulls down those fresh
      sheets rather cautiously before he slides in - somewhat tentatively.




      Do you think he sleeps? Not a wink! He tosses and turns all night, cannot
      wait to leave at daybreak, even before. As he leaves the motel, the
      manager sees him. 'Hi. Glad I caught you. I got a phone call around 2a.m.
      An eighteen wheeler ran over the second cobra about two miles up the road.
      Just thought you'd like to know.'




      Six weeks ago, the 'hsssss' of the cracked steam radiator was a
      meaningless neutral background sound, which quickly 'faded away' and
      afforded the salesman a pleasant restful sleep. Now, the exact same sound
      - same frequency, same intensity, same character - was the most intrusive,
      most annoying sound imaginable - only because it had taken on a new
      meaning. But was it really louder?




      It certainly seemed so to the salesman - even though the readings on a
      decibel metre placed in the room would have been identical. And since
      people who are afflicted with (subjective) tinnitus are the only people
      who can hear their tinnitus... perceived loudness is the only loudness
      that counts.




      Perceived loudness is a function of two variables - the magnitude of the
      signal... and the meaning assigned to that signal.

      The more a person focuses on their tinnitus, the louder it will seem, and
      the more distressed they will become. You must learn to shift your focus
      to other thoughts and activities so that gradually the periods where the
      brain is not focused on the sounds become more frequent and prolonged.




      Brain Function




      The brain cannot attend to two tasks at the same time and give full
      attention to both. As an example, when talking on the phone whilst
      watching TV - your brain will give priority to one or the other, but not
      both at the same time. In the same way, the brain cannot focus on tinnitus
      if tinnitus is not given priority. Take advantage of your brain's
      limitations - focus on something else.




      In the early stages, shifting your focus is not always easy. It takes
      practice and Â perseverance.




      When you become aware that you have not been listening to your tinnitus
      for a period, the brain has not been giving priority to the tinnitus.




      These periods of not focusing on your tinnitus become longer and more
      frequent as you become more relaxed about your tinnitus.




      Keep your brain active and avoid silence where possible by exposing
      yourself to low level background sounds such as a CD or radio playing
      softly in the background.




      When your tinnitus is troublesome, remain active. Go for that walk, or
      better still, socialise with others. Avoid the temptation to hibernate in
      front of the TV.




      It is more difficult to focus away from your tinnitus...




      \    In quiet environments


      \    During periods of mental and physical inactivity


      \    When you are tired and run down


      \    When it is the centre of attention - i.e. when you are talking,
      reading or thinking about your tinnitus




      REMEMBER:




      \    Silence should be avoided where possible.


      \    Use sound distraction to refocus your attention away from the
      tinnitus


      \    Tinnitus thrives on boredom




      Trying Too Hard




      Ross McKeown, President of the Tinnitus Association of Victoria




      I recently counselled a young man whose tinnitus was having a devastating
      effect upon his life. He had attended one of our Tinnitus Management
      Seminars but was finding it difficult to focus away from his tinnitus.




      After listening to him describe his unsuccessful attempts, I suggested he
      was trying too hard to shift his focus from the tinnitus.




      Paradoxically, the more we try to force our brain to focus on other
      things, the more it will remain fixed on our head noises.




      We know that the brain cannot attend to two tasks at the same time and
      give full attention to both. As an example, when talking on the phone
      whilst watching television, your brain will give priority to one or the
      other, but not both at the same time.




      In the same way, the brain cannot focus on tinnitus if tinnitus is not
      given priority.


      By trying to force our brain to shift its focus we are in effect giving
      our tinnitus priority, reinforcing the idea that the tinnitus is
      important.




      We will all have experienced a similar situation when we have had
      difficulty getting to sleep. The more you try to force yourself to fall
      asleep, and worry about it, the less chance you have of being successful.




      However by relaxing, making yourself comfortable and thinking about
      pleasant memories or anticipating coming events, you do eventually catch a
      sleep wave and drift off to sleep. When you awake you will have no
      recollection of actually falling asleep.




      Tinnitus is just the same. When we stop trying to force our brain away
      from the tinnitus, and simply go about our daily activities, our brain
      changes focus many times each day. And as we become more relaxed about our
      tinnitus these periods become longer and more frequent.




      As when we fall asleep, we are not aware of our brain switching away from
      our tinnitus. Only when we hear it again do we realise we have not been
      listening to our tinnitus.




      William Shatner, the American actor, said in an article he wrote for the
      American Tinnitus Association, "The moment you can divert your attention
      and don't hear your tinnitus, that's the moment you realise that all you
      have to do is occupy yourself, whether it's reading, work, play, love,
      family - any of these things, all of these things."




      So if you are having one of those days or periods when your tinnitus seems
      louder than usual, and you are more aware of it than usual, that is
      precisely the time you must increase your physical and mental activity.




      This will enable your brain to do what it does naturally - fi nd other
      things to focus on that are more interesting than your tinnitus.



       



      Accepting Tinnitus: the Problem of Focusing and Attention




      Dr Ross Dineen of Dineen and Westcott Audiology




      Acknowledging the presence of tinnitus




      The first step to accepting tinnitus is to acknowledge its presence, to
      stop avoiding or denying that it is present, and to acknowledge that it
      probably won't go away. Unfortunately for most people who have had
      tinnitus for more than 6 months it is unlikely that it will ever go away
      completely. So one of the first steps in coming to terms with tinnitus is
      to admit to yourself that the tinnitus does exist and that it will
      probably be part of you for the rest of your life.



       



      The importance of getting informed




      When you first become aware of your tinnitus you may find yourself
      constantly thinking about it, worrying about it. Why is it there? What has
      caused it? Does it mean I've got a brain tumour, that I'm going crazy,
      that I'm going to go profoundly deaf? Will it ever go away? How can I ever
      learn to live with this thing? It will drive me crazy! The more you worry
      about tinnitus the more overwhelming it seems.




      Everyone asks these questions. These are a normal reaction and an
      important part of coming to terms with tinnitus. What is not reasonable is
      to constantly ask these same questions over and over again, without
      actively setting out to find the answers to the questions.



       



      Focusing on tinnitus




      By constantly worrying about the significance of the tinnitus you keep it
      at the forefront of your attention, giving the tinnitus a significance in
      your health and well-being which is most likely unwarranted. This is an
      essential part of becoming a "tinnitus sufferer". By making tinnitus a
      focus of your attention you can highlight its persistence and amplify your
      sense of being plagued by the tinnitus. The more you listen to, or attend
      to your tinnitus, the louder and more overwhelming it seems to become.



       



      Attention and tinnitus




      The process of attending to the tinnitus highlights it in relation to
      environmental sounds, so that it seems to stand out from, and appears much
      louder than, other environmental sounds. We all live in a world full of
      noise. In most situations we are surrounded by a range of different noises
      and sounds that we can selectively listen to or ignore depending on the
      situation we are in at the time, the nature of the activity we are engaged
      in, and our level of emotional excitation or arousal. We never listen to
      all the sounds that we are capable of hearing in a given situation at the
      one time. To try and do so would be overwhelming.




      Typically we notice one thing after another. The sound of a door banging,
      the buzzing of a fly, the drone of air conditioning in the room, the
      rumble of traffic in the distance, all these sounds may be all present at
      the same time but typically we tend only to notice the sounds one at a
      time. The process of attention is simply to bring something into our
      conscious mind, our attention system. We attend first to those things that
      occur in a surprising way. For example if the door bangs, it arouses our
      attention, though if it happens frequently then the power of the sound to
      grab our attention tends to diminish over time.




      Secondly we attend to those things which are useful to the activity which
      we are engaged in, for example, the murmur of voices in the next room
      indicating that guests have arrived. If a sound is boring or repetitive or
      meaningless we tend to stop paying attention to it. The ticking of a
      clock, the hum of air conditioning in a room, the sound of our own
      breathing, all become monotonous and no longer draw or catch our
      attention, unless for some reason our attention is drawn to the sound by
      it changing in some way.




      In a similar way when we are engaged in a repetitive activity, like
      driving a car, our immediate attention can wander from the task. We can
      drive automatically though our mind may be miles away, but if anything
      unusual occurs which potentially signals danger, like a flashing red light
      in the distance, our attention is drawn immediately back to the task at
      hand.




      Tinnitus has been termed a disorder of attention. In most instances
      tinnitus is not a significant warning signal in terms of your physical or
      psychological survival. In most cases it is an annoying but benign symptom
      of changes that have occurred in our auditory functioning. It deserves to
      be treated like any other repetitive, boring sound in the immediate
      environment. We should be able to ignore it, to selectively focus our
      attention away from it, yet often when we first experience tinnitus we
      cannot stop thinking about it. We worry it, like a dog worries a bone.




      Part of the process of adjusting to tinnitus is finding out about our
      tinnitus, about the significance that it has to our health and emotional
      well-being so that we can begin to treat it with the disdain that it so
      richly deserves. If we see our tinnitus as just another boring repetitive
      sound in the environment, we can choose to attend to it or ignore it as we
      see fit. Obviously if it changes in some way, or gets louder, our
      attention will be drawn back to it. But through an understanding of the
      factors which affect our perception of the tinnitus we can work out what
      has caused it to change, and through that process allow it to recede back
      into the general level of background sound.



       



      Mental distraction from tinnitus




      When we first notice tinnitus it may seem like an ever present intrusion,
      one from which we cannot get any relief. It constantly demands our
      attention. Yet even when it is at its most apparent we found that we are
      able to temporarily forget about it, if we are involved in a task which
      demands our full concentration.




      Many people when they first get tinnitus actively seek tasks which demand
      such concentration, as when absorbing ourselves into a favourite hobby, or
      doing cross-words or mental tasks, as a way of giving ourselves some
      relief from the constant awareness of the tinnitus. This approach works
      quite well during the day, but becomes more of a problem at night when we
      are trying to relax or trying to get to sleep, or if we wake-up during the
      night, as there is less noise and activity around us to distract us from
      the tinnitus.




      When we start to listen to the tinnitus, it seems to get louder and louder
      and more overwhelming. The more that we focus on it, the louder it seems
      to get.




      Activities which previously allowed us some temporary relief from the
      pressures of the world, such as day-dreaming or sleeping, can become
      another source of distress and frustration because of the intrusion of
      tinnitus. This situation shows tinnitus at its most annoying stage as, by
      disturbing our ability to rest and relax, it starts to undermine our
      perception of our ability to cope with life in general and our sense of
      health and well-being.



       



      Distraction as an aid to sleeping




      Nearly everyone who experiences a distressing level of tinnitus
      experiences a period of sleep disturbance.




      Part of the process of coming to terms with tinnitus is developing a range
      of strategies to minimize the awareness of tinnitus when trying to sleep
      or relax. These techniques are intended to enable you to switch your focus
      of attention away from the tinnitus, without stimulating you to the point
      where relaxation or sleep becomes impossible.




      Refocusing strategies can be either cognitive, that is using the mind or
      mental activity to distract you from focusing on the tinnitus, or
      behavioural in that they involve physical activity or sound, to aid
      switching your focus of attention away from the tinnitus. Nearly all the
      management techniques or coping strategies that we use to deal with
      periods of heightened awareness of the tinnitus are a form of distraction
      or refocusing technique.



       



      Coping strategies and tinnitus




      Coping strategies which we use to manage periods of crisis can be divided
      into two main types of behaviour, these are problem-solving and emotion
      regulation.


      Problem solving or problem-focused coping strategies are activities
      directed towards modifying, avoiding or minimizing the impact of stress,
      or mental activities that lead to the belief that a source of stress can
      be controlled.




      Emotion regulation or emotion-focused coping strategies refers to attempts
      to reduce potentially dysfunctional or destructive emotional reactions,
      which are the result of exposure to stress. Strategies such as denial and
      wishful thinking are used to avoid direct confrontation with the source of
      the stress.




      Some researchers into stress management and coping emphasise the positive
      adaptive value of problem solving mechanisms where the problem-focused
      approach facilitates mastery of the environment.




      Emotion-focused coping styles, on the other hand, are viewed by some
      researchers as being less adaptive in comparison to problem-focused coping
      strategies.


      Some examples of problem-solving activities directed towards minimizing of
      the impact of the tinnitus are:




      \    Seeking information about the significance of tinnitus in your
      overall health, rather than just worrying about it.


      \    Getting and using a hearing-aid if you also have hearing problems.


      \    Finding out about how you can use sound to overwhelm your awareness
      of the tinnitus, to give you temporary relief from focusing on the
      tinnitus.




      Some examples of emotion-regulation activities that avoid direct
      confrontation with the emotional reactions elicited by the tinnitus are:




      \    Denying that you have a problem or pretending that it's not happening
      (denial can be useful in managing short-term crisis, but if the problem
      persists denial can be destructive as you can end up ill prepared to cope
      with a long-term problem)


      \    Wishful thinking, such as hoping that it will just go away, or trying
      to think about something else which is more pleasant than listening to
      your tinnitus


      \    Learning and regularly using relaxation and stress management
      techniques that reduce the level of emotional response to stressful
      situations.



       



      Accepting the Fluctuations of Your Tinnitus




      Ross McKeown, President of the Tinnitus Association of Victoria




      There are many reasons why we experience temporary increases in our
      tinnitus. Whether the loudness has increased or we are simply listening to
      it more than usual, the result is the same. We know that we are focusing
      on our tinnitus more than usual and we find ourselves becoming preoccupied
      with our tinnitus.




      We know there are many factors that can cause these fluctuations; stress,
      anxiety, poor health, tiredness, certain foods and drinks, medications
      etc...




      In the early stages of tinnitus many people become anxious and even
      fearful of sudden increases in their tinnitus, believing that the increase
      might be permanent. However, in time you begin to realise that the
      tinnitus usually settles down to its normal level.




      As you gain more knowledge about your own tinnitus you become more relaxed
      about the fluctuations.




      I now know the different foods, drinks and other factors that increase the
      level of my tinnitus, but as most of them are things that I enjoy, I
      consider a short-term increase in my tinnitus a small price to pay.




      If you find that your tinnitus has been louder than normal for an extended
      period then it is important to examine your lifestyle.




      Ask yourself :




      \    Have I become tired and run-down?


      \    Am I working too hard?


      \    Are there things I am particularly worried about at the moment?


      \    Am I getting enough exercise and relaxation?


      \    Are there unresolved problems preying on my mind?




      Any of the above could be responsible for the increase.




      In fact you can actually turn your tinnitus into a positive. If it has
      been louder than normal for a while you know it is time to reflect on your
      lifestyle and make the necessary changes.


      Remember, gain a deeper understanding of your tinnitus and begin to accept
      the fluctuations as normal.




      You will be far more relaxed about your tinnitus when you do.

Some of the Do's and Don'ts of managing your tinnitus are:\n\nDON'T ... \n\n* \\    Continually monitor the level of your tinnitus\n* \\    Work through an endless range of cures\n* \\    Live in hope of a miracle cure\n* \\    Talk about it constantly with family and friends\n* \\    Remain angry about this unfair intrusion in your life\n* \\    Spend frequent periods listening to your tinnitus\n* \\    Remain anxious/depressed about your tinnitus\n* \\    Feel guilty about not coping\n\n\t\n\nDO ...\n\n* \\    Overcome your fear of tinnitus\n* \\    Accept your tinnitus as a normal part of your life\n* \\    Stop worrying about it\n* \\    Keep busy and focus on stimulating and enjoyable activities\n* \\    Surround yourself with ambient and environmental sounds\n* \\    Gain strength from others who successfully manage their tinnitus\n* \\    Employ relaxation & stress management strategies that work for you\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalising Your Life\n\n\n\nIan Paterson, Vice President, Tinnitus Association of Victoria\n\n\n\nIn addition to the 4 keys to successful tinnitus management, over the last few years I have come to realise the importance of a 'fifth key', it is to 'Normalise your life as much as possible'.\n\n\n\nWe assume that by instituting the fours keys outlined previously that the natural outcome is a return to a 'normal' life similar to what we enjoyed prior to developing tinnitus. Unfortunately this is not always the case as many people continue to allow their tinnitus to have a greater level of importance in their brain than it deserves, thus affecting their reaching 'total habituation' and acceptance of their tinnitus.\n\n\n\nFar more importantly for those who have just developed tinnitus or those that are on the route to habituation but are still not completely comfortable with their tinnitus, normalising your life during the habituation process actually accelerates that process. It is the little things that will make the difference, going to that social function even though there will be noise greater than you are comfortable with (take ear plugs!), or doing the normal chores such as mowing the lawn (use ear plugs and or ear muffs), going shopping or visiting the kids or grandkids - these things are the very essence of a 'normal' life.\n\n\n\nBy doing these 'normal' activities, and not mentally or physically isolating yourself because of your tinnitus, will provide short term quality of life experiences as well as a process that will hasten the habituation process.\n\n\n\nThe opposite of what I am suggesting is of course surrendering to your tinnitus and using it as an excuse not to partake in life. Almost invariably when I get someone on the advice line saying that their tinnitus has 'ruined their quality of life', it turns out that they have cut off almost if not all 'normal' activities. It is what we describe as the 'tinnitus prison' where the person has built a psychological wall around themselves that mentally and physically isolates them. This leads to the person focusing on their tinnitus and allowing the tinnitus to manage and determine everything they do rather than them learning to manage it.\n\n\n\nSo what can you do to 'normalise' your life?\n\nI tell people that it is a simple 6 step plan\n\n\n\n\\    Determine that you are going to manage your tinnitus from this point forward and not let it manage you.\n\n\\    Always ask yourself 'if I didn't have tinnitus, what would I be doing today' and DO IT!\n\n\\    Plan your days each evening so that you have a 'plan' for the following few days, do not just fill up your plan with 'chores', include 'treats' for yourself such as meeting friends for coffee and cake at your favourite patisserie etc.\n\n\\    Maintain your social contacts and outings, no matter how your tinnitus is affecting you at that time.\n\n\\    NEVER use your tinnitus as an excuse not to do something whether it is mowing the lawn, going out, sitting quietly reading a book (yes you can do that!) or having that red wine, chocolate or other foods that you may enjoy.\n\n\\    Maintain a PMA (Positive Mental Attitude) as the more you work at implementing the '5 keys', the faster you will reach habituation and be totally comfortable and relaxed with your tinnitus.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Tinnitus Prison\n\n\n\nIan Paterson, Vice President, Tinnitus Association of Victoria\n\n\n\nIt is common for the brain to concentrate on negatives in a person's life and cause the person to view their particular problem, or situation, in unrealistic or exaggerated circumstances. The bigger the negative or perceived problem, the more the mind focuses on the problem.\n\n\n\nThis increased focus can cause mental and physical problems, resulting in further isolation from friends, family and society. When this happens, your life has no enjoyment or fun and every minute of your existence revolves around your tinnitus. Thus you are confined and isolated in your tinnitus prison.\n\n\n\nThis not only affects you, it can affect everyone you care about and have contact with as they suffer the results of your depression and your withdrawal from life. Inevitably you end up in a downward spiral where your tinnitus and self imposed isolation builds a mental 'brick wall' around you as impenetrable as any prison wall.\n\n\n\nYou must break out of this 'tinnitus prison' and start 'living life'.\n\n\n\nTo do this takes planning - planning to enjoy yourself; planning to start living life; planning for the future - by building ladders of positive expectations to scale the walls of the prison you are in.\n\n\n\nThis can be in the form of a day-by-day plan to visit friends, go for a walk etc, or it can take a more structured and long-term form.\n\n\n\nPersonal Planning Documents are available on the Internet. Pick one that you think is to your liking and fill it out. The difference between living a full, satisfying life and just existing, is planning.\n\n\n\nRemember, you are in control of your life. If you decide that you want more out of life, you can have it.\n\n\n\nYou only need to decide what you want and work towards it.\n\n\n\nThe planning process is about assessing the past, determining future objectives and then identifying the intermediate steps necessary to reach those objectives within realistic time frames.\n\n\n\nRemember that your objectives should be SMART i.e. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Rewarding, and Timely. When you have gone over your Personal Plan and it is as good as you can make it, put it where you will see it each day, and review it and your progress towards the objectives each month.\n\n\n\nBe pro-active, take charge of your own destiny. Nobody can or will do it for you, you must do it yourself!\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Have Two Choices\n\n\n\nIan Paterson, Vice President, Tinnitus Association of Victoria\n\n\n\nAt the Tinnitus Management Seminars we illustrate the point that 'The way you think about a situation determines your emotional and physical reaction'. In other words, if you have the correct mental approach to your tinnitus, it will cease to be a problem. This change in mental approach is fundamental to getting on top of your tinnitus and is the basis of the 4 keys to managing tinnitus that we teach in the seminars.\n\n\n\nWhile sorting through the emails that arrived at my computer recently, I came across one from a co-worker with whom I had been discussing the difference in mental approach of another two co-workers that illustrated the point perfectly. The email was not about tinnitus, but like so many stories illustrating how to get the most out of life, it has a powerful and very pertinent message that any person with tinnitus should understand and live by. The author of the story is unknown, but I would like to share the story with you and encourage everyone to examine how changing your attitude to your tinnitus could improve your perception of your tinnitus and ultimately your quality of life.\n\n\n\nJerry is the manager of a restaurant. He is always in a good mood. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would always reply \"If I were any better, I would be twins\"\n\n\n\nMany of the waiters at the restaurant quit their jobs when he changed jobs, so they could follow him around and work where he worked.\n\n\n\nWhy?\n\n\n\nBecause Jerry was a natural motivator. If an employee had a bad day, Jerry was always there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.\n\n\n\nObserving this made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry and asked him \"I don't get it! No one can be a positive person all the time. How do you do it?\"\n\n\n\nJerry Replied, \"Each morning I wake up and say to myself, I have two choices today. I can choose to be in a good mood or I can choose to be in a bad mood, I always choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I can choose to learn from it. I always choose to learn from it\".\n\n\n\n\"Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life. I always choose the positive side of life\"\n\n\n\n\"But it is not always that easy\" I protested \"Yes it is,\" Jerry said.\n\n\n\n\"Life is about choices, when you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or a bad mood. It's you choice how you live your life\"\n\n\n\nSeveral years later I heard that Jerry accidentally did something you are never supposed to do in a restaurant, he left the back door to the restaurant open and in the morning he was robbed by three armed men. When Jerry was nervously trying to open the safe for the robbers, his hand slipped off the combination. The robbers panicked and shot him.\n\n\n\nLuckily Jerry was found quickly and rushed to hospital. After much surgery and weeks of intensive care Jerry was released from hospital with bullet fragments still in his body. I saw Jerry 6 months after the shooting and asked how he was. He replied \"If I was any better I'd be twins.\" I asked Jerry what had gone through his mind as the robbery took place.\n\n\n\n\"The first thing that went through my mind was that I should have locked the back door, then after they shot me and I remembered that I had two choices, I could choose to live or I could choose to die. I chose to live.\" When the paramedics got me to the emergency room and I saw the expressions on the faces of the staff, I knew that in their eyes I was going to die. I knew I needed to take action.\n\n\n\nAt the time there was a nurse shouting questions at me asking if I was allergic to anything.\" \"yes I replied\" The doctors and nurses stopped working waiting for my reply, I took a deep breath and yelled \"Bullets\". Over their laughter I told them \"I am choosing to live. Please operate on me as if I am alive, not dead\". Jerry lived because of the skill of the doctors and his will to live.\n\n\n\nI learned from him that every day you have the choice to either enjoy your life or hate it. The only thing that is truly yours and no one can take it from you is your attitude to life.\n\n\n\nSo you have two choices, you can choose to allow tinnitus to rule your life, or you can choose to get on and live life to the full not allowing tinnitus to interfere in your life in any way. Personally I chose to live life to the full and not let my tinnitus manage me or affect my quality of life - you can do the same!"

      The aim of every tinnitus sufferer is to habituate to their tinnitus.




      This means reaching a state of mind where you no longer have a negative
      emotional response to your tinnitus.




      We habituate or adapt to various stimuli every day of our lives:




      \    the feel of our clothes on our bodies


      \    the unchanging things we see around us each day


      \    traffic noise....




      We all know people who have moved to a home or workplace on a busy street.
      At first they find the traffic noise distracting, even distressing, but in
      time reach the point where they are rarely even aware of the noise that
      surrounds them. This is called habituation.




      In general, the noises we are most able to ignore are predictable,
      repetitive sounds we perceive as nonthreatening, uninteresting and
      unimportant.




      Progression towards Habituation




      Progression towards habituation is not a case of going from one level to
      another and not having relapses or bad days. Tinnitus sufferers have days
      when they may be overtired or have underlying stress in their lives.
      Tinnitus will be more troublesome on those days. However, through learning
      to manage your tinnitus, the bad days will be fewer and further apart.




      As you learn to manage your tinnitus and progress towards habituation,
      changes will take place in the areas of depression, anxiety, your ability
      to concentrate, shifting your focus from the tinnitus and insomnia. In the
      early stages the majority of people have trouble in several or all of
      these areas. As you move towards habituation, each area will gradually
      improve to the point where you are rarely troubled by your tinnitus and it
      does not interfere with normal activities. Although the tinnitus will
      still be present, you will not be emotionally disturbed by it, or overly
      aware of it.



       

      Tinnitus Habituation, and the Therapeutic use of Sound in the Management
      of Tinnitus




      Myriam Westcott, Dineen and Westcott Audiology




      Habituation to tinnitus




      Most people who develop persistent tinnitus will spontaneously habituate
      or adapt to their tinnitus over time, so that while the tinnitus may still
      be heard, attention is rarely given to it and emotional acceptance is
      achieved - the tinnitus is neither pleasant nor unpleasant. Habituation is
      a normal reaction to any persistent stimulus. For example, just after
      putting your clothes on in the morning they can be felt on the skin, but
      this sensation lasts only a very short time. During the day, you do not
      notice their touch, even though skin receptors continue to send signals to
      the brain about the sensation of your clothes against your skin.




      As you move towards habituation, you will notice a gradual increase in the
      periods of time when you are not aware of your tinnitus, as well as a
      gradual reduction in any annoyance or distress it may have caused. Illness
      and stress can lead to moving backwards in this process. Sometimes people
      become stuck and are unable to habituate as fully to their tinnitus as
      they would like. An awareness and understanding of your individual pattern
      of coping with setbacks and trauma, as well as stress management, may be
      required for habituation to be achieved.




      Most therapeutic approaches to tinnitus management, including Tinnitus
      Retraining Therapy (TRT), aim for tinnitus habituation to be achieved. TRT
      is based on the neurophysiological model of tinnitus, and is a treatment
      aimed at retraining the subconscious parts of the brain to ignore the
      tinnitus sound.




      Sound Enrichment




      Research has shown that almost everyone develops temporary tinnitus, if
      put in an abnormally quiet environment (such as a sound proof booth) and
      instructed to pay attention to any sound they may hear. You are more
      likely to notice or listen to your tinnitus in a quiet room. This
      increased awareness may lead to an increase in active monitoring of the
      tinnitus. This, in turn, may lead to an escalating cycle of increased
      irritation and distress, which will, in turn, increase the awareness and
      the intrusiveness of your tinnitus.




      According to the neurophysiological model of tinnitus and hyperacusis,
      when people with tinnitus remain in a quiet environment for some time, the
      gain (or volume) in the central auditory pathway increases, resulting in
      enhancement of the tinnitus sound.




      Our senses react not to the absolute value of a stimulus, but to the
      difference between the stimulus (or tinnitus) and the background. The
      tinnitus will not stand out as sharply and will be less obvious when
      surrounded by another sound.




      Sound enrichment involves adding sound to your environment. The aim is to
      surround the tinnitus sound with a neutral sound which is easily ignored.
      Sound enrichment is an important component of most approaches to tinnitus
      management, and is an integral part of Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT).
      For those people who have intermittent awareness of their tinnitus, sound
      enrichment can be restricted to times when the tinnitus is particularly
      noticeable or irritating. For people who are constantly aware of their
      tinnitus, 24-hour sound enrichment is recommended. This involves making
      sure there is always some sound present. By actively seeking to assert
      some control over the situation, the feelings of helplessness so often
      reported by people with tinnitus can be reduced.




      You do not have to actively listen to the sound you choose. In fact,
      particularly when you do not wish to be stimulated by the sound, it is
      best to adopt a passive approach to the sound by ignoring it. I like to
      describe the sound as "acoustic wallpaper".




      If you wish to listen to TV, radio and music, you will be distracted from
      your tinnitus, as well as less likely to be able to hear it. As a result
      it will become less prominent. However, most people don't want to be
      stimulated by these sounds for more than a few hours, let alone for 24
      hours, and it is then appropriate to use less stimulating and blander
      sounds. The important thing is to have available a variety of sounds to
      suit your mood and the degree of stimulation you want.




      There are many common sounds in our environment that are familiar,
      soothing, have pleasant associations or are at least neutral, and are
      fairly monotonous. For example, many people with tinnitus will not hear
      their tinnitus if walking on the beach, or in a park with the sound of
      birds and wind in the trees. This concept can be extended using an
      environmental sound generator, which typically produces a range of sounds
      such as ocean surf, bubbling river sounds etc. They can run on batteries
      as well as on mains electricity and are relatively portable.
      Alternatively, tapes/CDs of environmental sounds are available, some of
      which have gentle music incorporated.




      Some people find FM radio static (the hissing sound heard when the radio
      is tuned between stations) an inexpensive, accessible neutral sound. A
      Walkman style portable cassette/CD player/radio with lightweight
      headphones can be a relatively inexpensive sound system that you can carry
      around with you. If you have hearing aids, it is advisable to use them for
      most of the day to enhance your awareness of these environmental sounds.




      The sounds used should never cause annoyance or be unpleasant in any way.
      Because these sounds are neutral and relatively bland, they are easy to
      ignore. As a result, most people readily habituate to them.




      Masking - how is it different to sound enrichment?




      According to TRT, there is an ideal volume level when using a stable sound
      source such as a sound generator or CD. The volume should be set so that
      it starts to "mix" or blend with the tinnitus, and so that you can hear
      both your tinnitus as well as the sound used. To assist habituation to
      your tinnitus you need to be able to hear it along with the sound chosen.
      For this reason it is advisable not to swamp or "mask" your tinnitus for
      prolonged periods of time.




      The discovery that tinnitus could be masked or blocked out by external
      sounds has been credited to the ancient Greeks over 2000 years ago.
      Tinnitus masking is not regarded as a form of treatment for tinnitus, but
      can provide relief in the short term by substituting a more pleasant sound
      for the tinnitus.




      Sound enrichment during sleep




      Constant low level neutral sound in the bedroom is recommended if your
      sleep is disturbed by your tinnitus. The tinnitus will not be as obvious
      when surrounded by another sound, whether you are trying to fall asleep or
      if you wake during the night. We have 3 or 4 periods of light sleep during
      the night, and some researchers claim that we are then able to hear our
      tinnitus. If your tinnitus causes you irritation or distress, hearing it
      could wake you up during those periods of light sleep. This is less likely
      to occur in the presence of other sound




      When trying to fall asleep, don't focus on the low-level sound but let it
      move into the background of your awareness. To stop you focussing on your
      tinnitus, use gentle distraction strategies that do not involve sound,
      such as reading. Active relaxation exercises during the day can be useful
      in helping you to sleep more deeply. These can include progressive muscle
      relaxation exercises, breathing exercises and positive visualisation, all
      of which are available on tape/CD. Open Leaves Bookshop (79 Cardigan St.,
      Carlton tel: 9347 2355) carries a range of books on stress management, as
      well as tapes/CDs. Yoga, meditation, tai chi classes can be of benefit as
      they incorporate or are based on active relaxation strategies.




      Customised sound generators




      For people with high levels of tinnitus related distress, who wish to
      follow a TRT approach to tinnitus management and have normal hearing, the
      fitting of customised, wearable sound generators is recommended in both
      ears. These look like hearing aids, fit either inside or behind the ears
      and provide low-level white noise, which sounds like a gentle hissing.
      They have an adjustable volume control, so that the recommended volume
      level can be set.




      The advantage of customised sound generators is that they are discrete,
      portable, and provide a well-controlled, stable sound source. Because the
      sound they provide is constant, neutral, bland, and doesn't change in
      volume, you will find that it is easily ignored. Customised sound
      generators allow the ear canal to remain open, resulting in minimal
      interference with the ability to hear external sounds. Environmental sound
      enrichment can be used in addition to the customised sound generators.




      Once an acceptable level of habituation to your tinnitus is reached, the
      use of the sound generators can be discontinued.




      Tinnitus and hearing loss - Hearing Aids




      People with a hearing loss often blame their tinnitus for their hearing
      problems, particularly when communicating in groups and in background
      noise. The tinnitus is a symptom of the hearing loss, not the cause. If
      you have a hearing loss, then hearing aids will be effective in both the
      management of your hearing loss and your tinnitus.




      Hearing aids, by amplifying external sounds around you, will result in
      your internal noise, or tinnitus, becoming less noticeable. To be
      effective in managing both the hearing loss and the tinnitus, hearing aids
      need to be worn for most of the day.




      The effort of straining to hear a conversation and the resultant
      communication difficulties frequently lead to frustration, fatigue and
      stress. These are all major aggravating factors in tinnitus awareness and
      annoyance. Once you have adapted to the amplification provided by your
      hearing aids, you can expect a significant reduction in stress and
      fatigue.




      Because your hearing loss is likely to have developed over some time, your
      concept of what is "normal " hearing has also slowly changed. When hearing
      aids are fitted for the first time, and sounds are boosted to the level
      they should be heard, your concept of what is "normal" hearing will need
      to be adjusted. Many sounds will seem unnaturally prominent or noticeable
      for the first few weeks, as it takes time for the brain to relearn these
      sounds. This adaptation or adjustment period may last up to several
      months. For this process of adaptation to occur, it is advisable to use
      your hearing aids for most of the day.




      Your hearing aid may be less effective as a tinnitus management tool when
      you are in a quiet environment. Sound enrichment is required, using the
      strategies previously outlined. It is important to remember, however, that
      most people with a hearing loss will have a reduced ability to hear a
      voice through background noise. Digital signal processing hearing aids are
      now available with multiple channels, twin microphones and noise
      suppression features to assist communication in background noise.
      Conventional hearing aids do not have these features.




      When you remove your hearing aids, you may notice your tinnitus appears
      more prominent. Don't be concerned about this; it is simply due to the
      lack of amplification of environmental sounds making your tinnitus seem
      louder by contrast. Try not to remove your hearing aids in a quiet
      environment; increasing the volume of environmental sound will help.




      A combination hearing aid and sound generator is now available in one high
      quality digital signal processing device, allowing the wearer to switch
      between the two functions as needed. When in quiet you use the sound
      generator function; when there are environmental sounds or conversation to
      listen to, you use the hearing aid function. If you are using your sound
      generator function, you may miss hearing a voice speaking to you. Knowing
      that your attention will need to be gained prior to a speaker launching
      into conversation with you should overcome any communication issues that
      may arise.




      Further down the track, if you no longer need the sound generator function
      on the hearing aid, it can be reset to provide you with a second listening
      program for use in a noisy environment.
