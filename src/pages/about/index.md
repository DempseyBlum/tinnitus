        People with tinnitus may display the following behaviour in the early
        stages:


        * frequent mood swings

        * depression

        * anxiety attacks

        *  tension

        * irritability

        * frustration

        * poor concentration

        * sleep problems


        extreme distress, especially in the early stages, is common. However,
        the tinnitus does not cause these problems directly. It is your
        emotional response that causes the problems. Modifying your emotional
        response eliminates the majority of these problems.


        Critical Factors Affecting Tinnitus in the Early Stages


        * the quality of the medical examination (make sure that you research
        tinnitus as fully as you can before you attend your appointment with a
        medical practitioner).

        * comments made by members of the medical profession

        * the accuracy of the information given to the patient

        * whether the patient is made aware of the tinnitus support services
        available

        * whether the person receives appropriate counseling

        People with depression and anxiety disorders usually suffer from their
        mental disorder prior to the onset of tinnitus, and not the other way
        around. However, whether depression existed prior to the onset of the
        tinnitus, or a person has become anxious and depressed because of their
        tinnitus, it is important to seek help.


        Talking to your G.P. and spending time with an experienced tinnitus
        counsellor would be a good start.It is important to note that you can't
        always identify the cause of depression nor change troubling
        circumstances.


        The most important thing is to recognise the depression and to seek
        help.


        Remember, the sooner you get treatment, the greater the chance of a fast
        recovery.

        We all feel anxious from time to time, however, for some people, these
        anxious feelings are overwhelming and cannot be brought under control
        easily.


        An anxiety disorder is more than just feeling stressed â€“ it's a
        serious condition which makes it hard for the person to cope from day to
        day.


        Anxiety disorders are very common. One in four people will experience an
        anxiety disorder at some stage in their lives.


        Anxiety is common, especially for some in the early stages of their
        tinnitus. The sooner you get help, the sooner you will learn to control
        the condition.

        Most people assume that depression is caused simply by recent personal
        difficulties or a chemical imbalance in the brain. Depression however,
        is often caused by the mix of recent events and other longer-term or
        personal risk factors. Research indicates that ongoing difficulties,
        such as long-term unemployment or living in an abusive or uncaring
        relationship, are more likely to cause depression than recent life
        stressors.


        Depression can also run in families and some people will be at increased
        genetic risk. However, this doesn't mean that you will automatically
        become depressed if a parent or close relative has had the illness. Life
        circumstances are still likely to have an important influence on your
        chances of becoming ill. It's also common for people to experience
        depression and anxiety at the same time.

        There are many possible triggers of tinnitus. Among the most common are:


        * exposure to excessively loud noise

        * extreme stress or trauma

        * age related hearing loss

        * some prescription and non-prescription drugs


        It is important to consult your doctor and an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT)
        specialist to establish whether there is any underlying treatable
        medical reason for your tinnitus.

        When the brain first hears tinnitus it attempts to classify the sound
        from its stored data of sounds with which it is familiar. When no
        'match' can be made from previous experience, the brain focuses on the
        sound to such an extent that the sound is effectively magnified and the
        brain gives it a level of importance it does not deserve.


        This happens in the same way as when you are alone in your house at
        night and you hear the sound of a blind knocking against a window sill,
        or the floor boards expanding or contracting. Your senses go into a
        state of high alert, and the sounds are given unnecessary significance.
        This is because the limbic system within the brain is interpreting the
        sounds as signals of possible danger.


        In the same way, whenever you are aware of your tinnitus, your brain
        automatically interprets the sounds as a sign that something is terribly
        wrong, or as a danger signal. If this continues, your mind becomes
        obsessed with the sound, continually focusing on it and thus maintaining
        your topicBody and mind in a state of high alert.


        If this fearful pattern of thought is left unchecked, the negative
        response to the sound is reinforced. This 'programming' of the brain
        must be corrected so that you learn to manage your tinnitus rather than
        letting it manage you.

        Tinnitus is a symptom of a malfunction of the auditory system where by
        the sufferer hears sounds in the ears and head which are not associated
        with any external source.


        Approximately 17-20% of the population suffer from tinnitus to varying
        degrees.


        The Tinnitus Association of Victoria is a non-profit volunteer
        organisation providing a support network for tinnitus sufferers and
        their families. Tinnitus can be extremely debilitating, affecting
        peoples' abilities to work or cope with normal life activities.


        Many people are told that 'there is nothing that can be done' or 'you
        will have to learn to live with it'. This is totally wrong. Although
        there is no cure, people with tinnitus can learn techniques to
        successfully manage their tinnitus to the point where the tinnitus is no
        longer a problem for them, and they can continue to lead full and
        productive lives.
