      Sleeping problems or insomnia are very common in our society at any given
      time. Up to one third of adults have difficulty sleeping, and up to one
      fifth have serious difficulty sleeping. Having a disturbed sleep is a
      common reaction to a crisis. Insomnia is not a life-threatening problem,
      but if you are having disturbed sleep you will know just how disruptive it
      can be.




      True insomnia is properly defined as poor sleep accompanied by daytime
      fatigue. This includes being physically tired, having difficulty
      concentrating, and feeling depressed, irritable or lethargic. It is these
      daytime components of insomnia that are the problem. About half the people
      who have a distressing level of tinnitus initially report some sleep
      problems. People will often claim that their tinnitus causes the sleep
      problems. Interestingly researchers have found no correlation between the
      physical dimensions of persons' tinnitus, such as its loudness or the
      pitch of the sounds and the presence of sleep disturbance but other
      factors that occur in conjunction with the tinnitus.




      The need for sleep varies a lot between different people and tends to
      decline with increasing age. Around two-thirds of adults sleep 7-8 hours
      per night, a fifth less that 6 hours and one tenth more than 9 hours.
      Complete insomnia is a very rare condition. Some insomnia sufferers
      complain that they "didn't get a wink of sleep" but research has shown
      that most have "micro sleeps", very brief periods of sleep during periods
      of wakefulness which are so brief that they go unnoticed. One bad night's
      sleep, even as little as two hours, doesn't really effect your performance
      the next day although you may feel irritable, hostile, fatigued, or
      unhappy. Short sleep for a week makes some people pathologically tired,
      but even these cumulative effects disappear after one night's good sleep.
      So the real issue is not how much time you spend asleep but how you feel
      during the day.




      The initial sleep problems of some insomnia sufferers are triggered by an
      easily identified problem like a painful illness, a period of extreme
      stress or an increased awareness of tinnitus. But after the initial cause
      has faded in significance, the sleep problems can remain because they have
      become a part of your life. The act of going to bed can become a source of
      anxiety, as you worry about having yet another sleepless night. Often it
      is the worrying about whether or not you will be able to sleep tonight,
      the anticipatory anxiety that leads to a long-term sleeping problem.




      Sleep researchers agree that insomnia is not an illness itself, but a
      symptom of underlying problems. There are five groups of factors which
      have been shown to contribute to insomnia, these are:




      * **Biological factors** health problems such as arthritis, angina,
      migraines, asthma etc., which cause physical pain

      * **Psychological factors**, such as emotional crisis and stress.

      * **Use of drugs** including alcohol and sleeping medication.

      * **Disturbing environments and bad habits**, any aspect of the
      environment that impinges on your ability to get to sleep, e.g. Intrusive
      lighting, an uncomfortable bed, or disturbing noise, should be changed.
      With tinnitus, using other sound such as the radio on softly, or tapes of
      environmental sounds, to stop you focusing on the tinnitus can be very
      helpful.

      * **Conditioning**, the more you associate being in bed with struggling to
      sleep the harder it becomes to relax there. Only go to bed when you are
      sleepy.




      **Specialists in treating sleep disorders highlight two further points:**


      * No one with sleep disturbance experiences one of these factors in
      isolation. Significant sleep problems always involve the interaction of
      several of these possible causes.

      * Successful resolution of a sleep disorder requires careful defining of
      all the causes applying to that person, so that all of them are addressed.
      Even if your tinnitus is clearly the main factor contributing to your
      sleep problems there are almost certainly some of the other factors
      involved as well. If you want to solve your sleep problem you need to try
      and identify all of its possible causes and do something constructive
      about them.

      * **Learn to relax physically.** Attend a regular relaxation class, or use
      a self-help relaxation tape. Research has indicated that all the
      relaxation techniques such as yoga, meditation, biofeedback, progressive
      relaxation work equally well, so experiment and find the ones that suit
      you.

      * **Try to have a regular bedtime.** Don't go to bed if you don't feel
      sleepy. Do something quiet and relaxing until you do.

      * **If you are not going off to sleep easily, don't worry about it.** Try
      and focus your mind on something pleasant and relaxing. Do a simple
      relaxation exercise, like the progressive relaxation, so that you've got
      something to focus on other than your worries and/or your tinnitus.

      * **If you are not asleep after half an hour, get up.** Don't lie there
      tossing and turning and getting upset. Get up go into another room and do
      something quiet and relaxing until you feel drowsy and then go back to
      bed. The same applies if you wake during the night. It is better to spend
      an hour in the lounge room reading or listening to music, than an hour
      tossing in bed.

      * **Reduce alcohol, smoking, chocolate, coffee, tea, and caffeinated soft
      drinks.** People vary quite appreciably in their sensitivity to these
      substances. It is a good idea to reduce your consumption of them,
      especially in the late afternoon and evening.

      * **Keep fit with regular exercise.** Regular exercise helps you cope
      better with stress and helps reduce fatigue that can actually make
      sleeping difficult or disturbed.

      * **Don't eat heavy meals just before bedtime.** Carbohydrate-rich meals
      such as pasta for a main course or cake for dessert can have a calming or
      sedating effect, but you must give yourself time to digest them before bed
      and of course moderate the alcohol intake.

      * **Reserve your bed for sleep**. Don't take your worries to bed. Don't
      have important discussions and arguments in bed. Don't read disturbing
      books or watch horror movies in bed. Plan these activities for other times
      and places. Sex is OK as long as it leaves you feeling relaxed.

      * **Experiment with low intensity background sounds in the bedroom.** One
      of the problem areas with tinnitus is that it can become highlighted when
      you go to bed, as everything is so quiet and there is nothing to distract
      you from listening to, or focusing on, your tinnitus. The more you listen
      to your tinnitus the louder it seems to become. Listening to soft music
      when you go to bed can help - most clock radios have a snooze button which
      switches if off after up to one hour. Tape recordings of pleasant
      monotonous environmental sounds, such as rain on the roof, or ocean surf
      can stop you focusing on your tinnitus.

      * **Get up at the same time every day.** Some experts claim that this is
      more important than going to bed at the same time each day. Don't sleep
      in, even if you don't feel great for the rest of the day. You will only
      waste your sleep needs and upset your biological rhythms.

      * **Do not nap during the day.** If you have had a bad night's sleep, try
      to keep physically active rather than napping. This will help you sleep
      better the next night.

      * **Manage your daytime stress.** Regular practice of relaxation
      techniques is very important. Setting aside time each day for you, to
      focus on your needs, is an important part of effective stress management.

      * **Get medical advice.** If you think there are any medical problems that
      are contributing to your sleep disturbance seek medical advice. Don't let
      unresolved worries about your health ferment in the back of your mind, get
      advice and assistance. If sleep problems persist, don't put up with them;
      seek professional help for the sleep difficulties.

      Sleep continues to be a major problem for many people with tinnitus. The
      most common problem is that they wake during the night and then cannot get
      back to sleep, often blaming the tinnitus for initially waking them and
      then preventing them from getting back to sleep. Although tinnitus can
      cause a person to wake from sleep, there are many other more obvious
      factors that can cause this, such as irregular hours, having something on
      your mind, poor sleep habits etc. To understand what is happening when we
      are awakened from sleep and how to get back to sleep, we must understand
      our bio-clock or 'circadian rhythm'.


      Humans, like all other animals, are biologically programmed to follow a 24
      hour cycle that is linked to sunlight and darkness. This rhythm regulates
      natural chemicals that rise and fall within our bodies throughout the 24
      hour period governing periods of alertness and sleep, as well as those
      states between the two.


      Although humans have a circadian rhythm that dictates that we will be more
      alert during the day, and more likely to sleep during the hours of
      darkness, we all have minor variations that manifest themselves in some
      people being more a 'morning person' or a 'night owl' etc. These minor
      variations are not important. However, what is important is maintaining a
      regular routine in our 24 period. If you regularly go to bed at 10.00 p.m.
      each night, but decide to stay up until 3.00 a.m. for the next few nights,
      you are disturbing your natural rhythm and it is highly likely that you
      would not function at peak performance for the following few days. Part of
      any sleep management program dictates that you should go to bed when you
      are tired and get up at about the same time each day. This maintains your
      circadian rhythm.


      Part of our circadian rhythm is that we have a wave cycle happening
      throughout the day and night that allows our body to have periods of less
      intense alertness during the day, and periods of deeper rest during the
      night. Without this natural cycle occurring, we would be like a motor that
      is running on full throttle all the time and would soon 'burn-out'. At
      night this cycle continues, causing us to go from periods of rest to
      actually falling asleep. These cycles happen approximately every 90 to 120
      minutes and can be likened to waves that form in the ocean, they arrive on
      the beach at more or less regular intervals, and, when the wave of deep
      rest arrives, we are more likely to fall asleep.


      When some people wake during the night, they make a conscious effort to
      fall back to sleep immediately.


      When this does not happen, frustration and anxiety sets in and the more
      they try to get back to sleep, the more likely they are to toss and turn
      all night and NOT go back to sleep. The waves of deep rest that will lead
      to sleep will happen regularly throughout the night in the same way as
      waves reaching the beach.


      Surfboard riders can paddle as fast as they like between waves, but they
      will not go anywhere until a wave appears. In the same way, if you wake
      and your wave of deep rest is not upon you, you are better to physically
      and mentally relax, clear the mind and wait until the next wave of deep
      rest occurs at which time you will most likely go to sleep.


      If you can relate to waking during the night and having trouble getting
      back to sleep, recognise that your wave of deep rest may not be upon you
      yet. If you have been awake for 40 minutes or so and are experiencing
      anxiety in trying to sleep, get out of bed and do something that will
      occupy your mind for half an hour, such as writing a list of things to do
      tomorrow, writing a letter or doing a crossword. These activities will
      stop your 'sleep anxiety' and allow you to return to your bed ready for
      sleep.

      Eating heavy meals just before bedtime or eating late in the evening are
      likely to prevent you being able to get off to sleep quickly, this is well
      known, however there are also foods that you should avoid late in the day
      as they contain tyramine, an amino acid that increases the release of a
      brain stimulant and thus will likely influence your ability to relax and
      drift off to sleep, these foods are:


      **bacon, sugar, spinach, tomatoes, potatoes, ham, cheese and chocolate.**


      Conversly there are foods that are rich in trypophan, an amino acid that
      promotes sleep. These foods are


      **bananas, turkey, tuna, milk, whole grains, figs, dates and nuts**
