      From our earliest age our brain takes in sounds and classifies them
      according to whether they are threatening, neutral or non-threatening
      sounds. When the conscious mind classifies these sounds, the sub conscious
      mind has an automatic reaction to the sound the next time it is heard.
      This pattern will continue unless the conscious mind re-classifies the
      sound.




      When the conscious mind first hears tinnitus, it cannot correlate the
      sound with anything that it has heard, so our survival instincts means the
      brain will classify it as possibly threatening and will place the body and
      mind in a state of high alert for possible 'fight or flight'.




      If a person's initial reaction to the sound of their tinnitus is negative
      i.e. they are worried and fearful of the sound, a vicious cycle as shown
      below is established. This cycle can only be broken by addressing and
      overcoming one's fears.




      ![Graph showing how negative perception effects
      stress](/img/visciouscycle.gif "Vicious Cycle of Perception Char")




      **The way you think about a situation determines your emotional and
      physical reaction.**




      The following story from Dr Lawrence McKenna a UK psychologist illustrates
      the point.




      Pretend that you don't have tinnitus, and you're in a subway in New York
      jammed in like sardines, and some idiot comes up behind you, and starts
      jabbing you in the back with an umbrella. What happens?




      Well, if you're normal, you get upset, and you get mad. Your face gets
      red, your blood pressure goes up, and your pulse goes up. Those are
      physical changes in you based on the thought of the jerk who's stabbing
      you in the back with an umbrella. You turn around to tell him to stop, and
      you discover that it's not an umbrella, it's a gun. What happens?




      Your face goes pale, your palms get moist, your mouth gets dry. Those are
      physical changes in you based upon your thoughts about the stimulus - the
      very same stimulus, a poke in the back. So you turn around to give the guy
      all your money and you discover that it is not a gun. It's a blind lady
      with a cane trying to maintain her balance in this precarious situation.
      What happens?




      The colour returns to your face, a shudder of compassion comes over you,
      maybe a tear comes to your eyes. You try to assist her to a safe place in
      the subway. Again a different set of physical findings based upon your
      thoughts about the stimulus. So what's our stimulus? Our stimulus is our
      tinnitus. Changing the thoughts that we have about our tinnitus can not
      only impact on us philosophically, it can impact on us physically.




      Another example of your thoughts determining your emotional reaction to a
      situation is to imagine that three people were retrenched from their jobs.




      The first person thinks 'I am a Failure' , their emotional reaction is one
      of despair, anger, frustration and depression.




      The second person's thoughts are neutral, they therefore have no emotional
      reaction.


      The third person's thoughts are positive, 'I will take my payout and start
      that small business I have always wanted' , their emotional reaction is
      one of joy, hope, excitement and happiness.




      Each person was faced with the same situation, but because each person
      perceived their situation in a different way, they had a different
      emotional reaction.




      When you apply this philosophy to our situation of having tinnitus.....




      If your perception is negative, your emotional reaction will be one of
      despair, anxiety and depression. If your perception is neutral, 'It is
      difficult but I can cope' , you will have no emotional response.




      However if your perception is positive, 'I will manage it and not let it
      affect my life', your emotional reaction will be one of control, optimism
      and acceptance



       

      When a sound is threatening or unknown, the subconscious mind puts the
      brain and body into the 'fight or flight' survival mode.




      The following story from a paper presented by Dr. Stephen Nagler at a
      tinnitus seminar illustrates why a negative perception of tinnitus causes
      so much anxiety:




      (Dr. Nagler is a past Chairman of the Board of Directors of the American
      Tinnitus Association and for seven years served on ATA's Scientific
      Advisory Committee)




      There is a travelling salesman making several stops during a cold winter.
      He is chilly, tired, and hungry, but he has forgotten to make a motel
      reservation. He sees a motel by the side of the road. One level.




      Park right outside your room. Vacancy light flashing. The manager says
      that there is one room left, but unfortunately the steam radiator has a
      small crack in it; there is a constant 'hsssss' sound as steam escapes.




      The salesman is cold, tired and hungry, and takes the room gratefully. He
      enters the room, notices the quiet 'hsssss' sound and puts down his bags,
      eats a sandwich, brushes his teeth, takes a nice hot shower, puts on his
      pyjamas, pulls back the fresh linen on the bed, crawls in, and falls
      asleep.




      The next morning he awakes refreshed, and goes on his way. Six weeks later
      he finds himself in the same situation. Same town. Cold, tired, hungry. No
      reservation. He remembers the motel. The manager says, 'I have one room
      left. It's the same room you had six weeks ago, and I apologise: I have
      not yet had a chance to fix the steam radiator.' The salesman says 'No
      problem. I slept just great six weeks ago. I'll take it'.




      As he is walking down towards the room, the hotel manager yells to him,
      'Oh yes, one other thing. A couple of days ago a travelling circus came
      through our small town here, and two cobras escaped from the snake
      charmer. They caught one of them right there - about twenty yards up the
      street. And they expect to catch the other one any time now. Thought you'd
      like to know. Have a good night's sleep'.




      The salesman enters his room. He hears it. 'Hsssss' He looks carefully
      behind the curtain. Then he gets ready for that nice hot shower, but he
      slowly peeks into the shower before taking a quick shower. He then gets
      ready for bed. He looks under the bed first. He pulls down those fresh
      sheets rather cautiously before he slides in - somewhat tentatively.




      Do you think he sleeps? Not a wink! He tosses and turns all night, cannot
      wait to leave at daybreak, even before. As he leaves the motel, the
      manager sees him. 'Hi. Glad I caught you. I got a phone call around 2a.m.
      An eighteen wheeler ran over the second cobra about two miles up the road.
      Just thought you'd like to know.'




      Six weeks ago, the 'hsssss' of the cracked steam radiator was a
      meaningless neutral background sound, which quickly 'faded away' and
      afforded the salesman a pleasant restful sleep. Now, the exact same sound
      - same frequency, same intensity, same character - was the most intrusive,
      most annoying sound imaginable - only because it had taken on a new
      meaning. But was it really louder?




      It certainly seemed so to the salesman - even though the readings on a
      decibel metre placed in the room would have been identical. And since
      people who are afflicted with (subjective) tinnitus are the only people
      who can hear their tinnitus... perceived loudness is the only loudness
      that counts.




      Perceived loudness is a function of two variables - the magnitude of the
      signal... and the meaning assigned to that signal.

      The more a person focuses on their tinnitus, the louder it will seem, and
      the more distressed they will become. You must learn to shift your focus
      to other thoughts and activities so that gradually the periods where the
      brain is not focused on the sounds become more frequent and prolonged.




      Brain Function




      The brain cannot attend to two tasks at the same time and give full
      attention to both. As an example, when talking on the phone whilst
      watching TV - your brain will give priority to one or the other, but not
      both at the same time. In the same way, the brain cannot focus on tinnitus
      if tinnitus is not given priority. Take advantage of your brain's
      limitations - focus on something else.




      In the early stages, shifting your focus is not always easy. It takes
      practice and Â perseverance.




      When you become aware that you have not been listening to your tinnitus
      for a period, the brain has not been giving priority to the tinnitus.




      These periods of not focusing on your tinnitus become longer and more
      frequent as you become more relaxed about your tinnitus.




      Keep your brain active and avoid silence where possible by exposing
      yourself to low level background sounds such as a CD or radio playing
      softly in the background.




      When your tinnitus is troublesome, remain active. Go for that walk, or
      better still, socialise with others. Avoid the temptation to hibernate in
      front of the TV.




      It is more difficult to focus away from your tinnitus...




      \    In quiet environments


      \    During periods of mental and physical inactivity


      \    When you are tired and run down


      \    When it is the centre of attention - i.e. when you are talking,
      reading or thinking about your tinnitus




      REMEMBER:




      \    Silence should be avoided where possible.


      \    Use sound distraction to refocus your attention away from the
      tinnitus


      \    Tinnitus thrives on boredom




      Trying Too Hard




      Ross McKeown, President of the Tinnitus Association of Victoria




      I recently counselled a young man whose tinnitus was having a devastating
      effect upon his life. He had attended one of our Tinnitus Management
      Seminars but was finding it difficult to focus away from his tinnitus.




      After listening to him describe his unsuccessful attempts, I suggested he
      was trying too hard to shift his focus from the tinnitus.




      Paradoxically, the more we try to force our brain to focus on other
      things, the more it will remain fixed on our head noises.




      We know that the brain cannot attend to two tasks at the same time and
      give full attention to both. As an example, when talking on the phone
      whilst watching television, your brain will give priority to one or the
      other, but not both at the same time.




      In the same way, the brain cannot focus on tinnitus if tinnitus is not
      given priority.


      By trying to force our brain to shift its focus we are in effect giving
      our tinnitus priority, reinforcing the idea that the tinnitus is
      important.




      We will all have experienced a similar situation when we have had
      difficulty getting to sleep. The more you try to force yourself to fall
      asleep, and worry about it, the less chance you have of being successful.




      However by relaxing, making yourself comfortable and thinking about
      pleasant memories or anticipating coming events, you do eventually catch a
      sleep wave and drift off to sleep. When you awake you will have no
      recollection of actually falling asleep.




      Tinnitus is just the same. When we stop trying to force our brain away
      from the tinnitus, and simply go about our daily activities, our brain
      changes focus many times each day. And as we become more relaxed about our
      tinnitus these periods become longer and more frequent.




      As when we fall asleep, we are not aware of our brain switching away from
      our tinnitus. Only when we hear it again do we realise we have not been
      listening to our tinnitus.




      William Shatner, the American actor, said in an article he wrote for the
      American Tinnitus Association, "The moment you can divert your attention
      and don't hear your tinnitus, that's the moment you realise that all you
      have to do is occupy yourself, whether it's reading, work, play, love,
      family - any of these things, all of these things."




      So if you are having one of those days or periods when your tinnitus seems
      louder than usual, and you are more aware of it than usual, that is
      precisely the time you must increase your physical and mental activity.




      This will enable your brain to do what it does naturally - fi nd other
      things to focus on that are more interesting than your tinnitus.



       



      Accepting Tinnitus: the Problem of Focusing and Attention




      Dr Ross Dineen of Dineen and Westcott Audiology




      Acknowledging the presence of tinnitus




      The first step to accepting tinnitus is to acknowledge its presence, to
      stop avoiding or denying that it is present, and to acknowledge that it
      probably won't go away. Unfortunately for most people who have had
      tinnitus for more than 6 months it is unlikely that it will ever go away
      completely. So one of the first steps in coming to terms with tinnitus is
      to admit to yourself that the tinnitus does exist and that it will
      probably be part of you for the rest of your life.



       



      The importance of getting informed




      When you first become aware of your tinnitus you may find yourself
      constantly thinking about it, worrying about it. Why is it there? What has
      caused it? Does it mean I've got a brain tumour, that I'm going crazy,
      that I'm going to go profoundly deaf? Will it ever go away? How can I ever
      learn to live with this thing? It will drive me crazy! The more you worry
      about tinnitus the more overwhelming it seems.




      Everyone asks these questions. These are a normal reaction and an
      important part of coming to terms with tinnitus. What is not reasonable is
      to constantly ask these same questions over and over again, without
      actively setting out to find the answers to the questions.



       



      Focusing on tinnitus




      By constantly worrying about the significance of the tinnitus you keep it
      at the forefront of your attention, giving the tinnitus a significance in
      your health and well-being which is most likely unwarranted. This is an
      essential part of becoming a "tinnitus sufferer". By making tinnitus a
      focus of your attention you can highlight its persistence and amplify your
      sense of being plagued by the tinnitus. The more you listen to, or attend
      to your tinnitus, the louder and more overwhelming it seems to become.



       



      Attention and tinnitus




      The process of attending to the tinnitus highlights it in relation to
      environmental sounds, so that it seems to stand out from, and appears much
      louder than, other environmental sounds. We all live in a world full of
      noise. In most situations we are surrounded by a range of different noises
      and sounds that we can selectively listen to or ignore depending on the
      situation we are in at the time, the nature of the activity we are engaged
      in, and our level of emotional excitation or arousal. We never listen to
      all the sounds that we are capable of hearing in a given situation at the
      one time. To try and do so would be overwhelming.




      Typically we notice one thing after another. The sound of a door banging,
      the buzzing of a fly, the drone of air conditioning in the room, the
      rumble of traffic in the distance, all these sounds may be all present at
      the same time but typically we tend only to notice the sounds one at a
      time. The process of attention is simply to bring something into our
      conscious mind, our attention system. We attend first to those things that
      occur in a surprising way. For example if the door bangs, it arouses our
      attention, though if it happens frequently then the power of the sound to
      grab our attention tends to diminish over time.




      Secondly we attend to those things which are useful to the activity which
      we are engaged in, for example, the murmur of voices in the next room
      indicating that guests have arrived. If a sound is boring or repetitive or
      meaningless we tend to stop paying attention to it. The ticking of a
      clock, the hum of air conditioning in a room, the sound of our own
      breathing, all become monotonous and no longer draw or catch our
      attention, unless for some reason our attention is drawn to the sound by
      it changing in some way.




      In a similar way when we are engaged in a repetitive activity, like
      driving a car, our immediate attention can wander from the task. We can
      drive automatically though our mind may be miles away, but if anything
      unusual occurs which potentially signals danger, like a flashing red light
      in the distance, our attention is drawn immediately back to the task at
      hand.




      Tinnitus has been termed a disorder of attention. In most instances
      tinnitus is not a significant warning signal in terms of your physical or
      psychological survival. In most cases it is an annoying but benign symptom
      of changes that have occurred in our auditory functioning. It deserves to
      be treated like any other repetitive, boring sound in the immediate
      environment. We should be able to ignore it, to selectively focus our
      attention away from it, yet often when we first experience tinnitus we
      cannot stop thinking about it. We worry it, like a dog worries a bone.




      Part of the process of adjusting to tinnitus is finding out about our
      tinnitus, about the significance that it has to our health and emotional
      well-being so that we can begin to treat it with the disdain that it so
      richly deserves. If we see our tinnitus as just another boring repetitive
      sound in the environment, we can choose to attend to it or ignore it as we
      see fit. Obviously if it changes in some way, or gets louder, our
      attention will be drawn back to it. But through an understanding of the
      factors which affect our perception of the tinnitus we can work out what
      has caused it to change, and through that process allow it to recede back
      into the general level of background sound.



       



      Mental distraction from tinnitus




      When we first notice tinnitus it may seem like an ever present intrusion,
      one from which we cannot get any relief. It constantly demands our
      attention. Yet even when it is at its most apparent we found that we are
      able to temporarily forget about it, if we are involved in a task which
      demands our full concentration.




      Many people when they first get tinnitus actively seek tasks which demand
      such concentration, as when absorbing ourselves into a favourite hobby, or
      doing cross-words or mental tasks, as a way of giving ourselves some
      relief from the constant awareness of the tinnitus. This approach works
      quite well during the day, but becomes more of a problem at night when we
      are trying to relax or trying to get to sleep, or if we wake-up during the
      night, as there is less noise and activity around us to distract us from
      the tinnitus.




      When we start to listen to the tinnitus, it seems to get louder and louder
      and more overwhelming. The more that we focus on it, the louder it seems
      to get.




      Activities which previously allowed us some temporary relief from the
      pressures of the world, such as day-dreaming or sleeping, can become
      another source of distress and frustration because of the intrusion of
      tinnitus. This situation shows tinnitus at its most annoying stage as, by
      disturbing our ability to rest and relax, it starts to undermine our
      perception of our ability to cope with life in general and our sense of
      health and well-being.



       



      Distraction as an aid to sleeping




      Nearly everyone who experiences a distressing level of tinnitus
      experiences a period of sleep disturbance.




      Part of the process of coming to terms with tinnitus is developing a range
      of strategies to minimize the awareness of tinnitus when trying to sleep
      or relax. These techniques are intended to enable you to switch your focus
      of attention away from the tinnitus, without stimulating you to the point
      where relaxation or sleep becomes impossible.




      Refocusing strategies can be either cognitive, that is using the mind or
      mental activity to distract you from focusing on the tinnitus, or
      behavioural in that they involve physical activity or sound, to aid
      switching your focus of attention away from the tinnitus. Nearly all the
      management techniques or coping strategies that we use to deal with
      periods of heightened awareness of the tinnitus are a form of distraction
      or refocusing technique.



       



      Coping strategies and tinnitus




      Coping strategies which we use to manage periods of crisis can be divided
      into two main types of behaviour, these are problem-solving and emotion
      regulation.


      Problem solving or problem-focused coping strategies are activities
      directed towards modifying, avoiding or minimizing the impact of stress,
      or mental activities that lead to the belief that a source of stress can
      be controlled.




      Emotion regulation or emotion-focused coping strategies refers to attempts
      to reduce potentially dysfunctional or destructive emotional reactions,
      which are the result of exposure to stress. Strategies such as denial and
      wishful thinking are used to avoid direct confrontation with the source of
      the stress.




      Some researchers into stress management and coping emphasise the positive
      adaptive value of problem solving mechanisms where the problem-focused
      approach facilitates mastery of the environment.




      Emotion-focused coping styles, on the other hand, are viewed by some
      researchers as being less adaptive in comparison to problem-focused coping
      strategies.


      Some examples of problem-solving activities directed towards minimizing of
      the impact of the tinnitus are:




      \    Seeking information about the significance of tinnitus in your
      overall health, rather than just worrying about it.


      \    Getting and using a hearing-aid if you also have hearing problems.


      \    Finding out about how you can use sound to overwhelm your awareness
      of the tinnitus, to give you temporary relief from focusing on the
      tinnitus.




      Some examples of emotion-regulation activities that avoid direct
      confrontation with the emotional reactions elicited by the tinnitus are:




      \    Denying that you have a problem or pretending that it's not happening
      (denial can be useful in managing short-term crisis, but if the problem
      persists denial can be destructive as you can end up ill prepared to cope
      with a long-term problem)


      \    Wishful thinking, such as hoping that it will just go away, or trying
      to think about something else which is more pleasant than listening to
      your tinnitus


      \    Learning and regularly using relaxation and stress management
      techniques that reduce the level of emotional response to stressful
      situations.



       



      Accepting the Fluctuations of Your Tinnitus




      Ross McKeown, President of the Tinnitus Association of Victoria




      There are many reasons why we experience temporary increases in our
      tinnitus. Whether the loudness has increased or we are simply listening to
      it more than usual, the result is the same. We know that we are focusing
      on our tinnitus more than usual and we find ourselves becoming preoccupied
      with our tinnitus.




      We know there are many factors that can cause these fluctuations; stress,
      anxiety, poor health, tiredness, certain foods and drinks, medications
      etc...




      In the early stages of tinnitus many people become anxious and even
      fearful of sudden increases in their tinnitus, believing that the increase
      might be permanent. However, in time you begin to realise that the
      tinnitus usually settles down to its normal level.




      As you gain more knowledge about your own tinnitus you become more relaxed
      about the fluctuations.




      I now know the different foods, drinks and other factors that increase the
      level of my tinnitus, but as most of them are things that I enjoy, I
      consider a short-term increase in my tinnitus a small price to pay.




      If you find that your tinnitus has been louder than normal for an extended
      period then it is important to examine your lifestyle.




      Ask yourself :




      \    Have I become tired and run-down?


      \    Am I working too hard?


      \    Are there things I am particularly worried about at the moment?


      \    Am I getting enough exercise and relaxation?


      \    Are there unresolved problems preying on my mind?




      Any of the above could be responsible for the increase.




      In fact you can actually turn your tinnitus into a positive. If it has
      been louder than normal for a while you know it is time to reflect on your
      lifestyle and make the necessary changes.


      Remember, gain a deeper understanding of your tinnitus and begin to accept
      the fluctuations as normal.




      You will be far more relaxed about your tinnitus when you do.
