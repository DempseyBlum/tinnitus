It is important to address these fears with an experienced tinnitus counsellor.\n\nListed below are some of the main fears expressed by people with tinnitus and the reality regarding those fears.\n\n| The Fear       | The Reality   |\n| ----------- |-------------|\n| Do I have:\na serious illness\na brain tumor\na blood clot     | Approximately 4% of people with tinnitus are found to have a treatable medical condition. A thorough medical examination by your G.P. and ENT will determine whether you are in the 4% |\n| Will my tinnitus drive me insane?      | No. In the early stages it may have a huge emotional impact, but it is not linked to insanity.     |\n| Will it get louder? | Research suggests that you do not need to fear tinnitus increasing with age. Other factors may temporarily increase your tinnitus.      |\n| Will it continue forever? | If you have had your tinnitus for longer than 6 months it is most likely that you have permanent tinnitus.      |\n| It can't be cured | There is no cure, however, there are very effective and successful management strategies.     |\n| I will have no more peace and quiet | It is true that very quiet environments should be avoided, but peaceful and restful times can still be enjoyed.     |\n| It will interfere with my concentration | Your concentration will be affected in the early stages. However, as you begin to successfully manage your tinnitus your concentration will improve..     |\n| It will affect my sleep | sleep \tMany people with tinnitus have sleep problems in the early stages. More normal sleep patterns return when you become less anxious about your tinnitus and find distraction techniques that help you get off to sleep   |\n**It is important to overcome your fears.

      From our earliest age our brain takes in sounds and classifies them
      according to whether they are threatening, neutral or non-threatening
      sounds. When the conscious mind classifies these sounds, the sub conscious
      mind has an automatic reaction to the sound the next time it is heard.
      This pattern will continue unless the conscious mind re-classifies the
      sound.




      When the conscious mind first hears tinnitus, it cannot correlate the
      sound with anything that it has heard, so our survival instincts means the
      brain will classify it as possibly threatening and will place the body and
      mind in a state of high alert for possible 'fight or flight'.




      If a person's initial reaction to the sound of their tinnitus is negative
      i.e. they are worried and fearful of the sound, a vicious cycle as shown
      below is established. This cycle can only be broken by addressing and
      overcoming one's fears.

      **The way you think about a situation determines your emotional and
      physical reaction.**




      The following story from Dr Lawrence McKenna a UK psychologist illustrates
      the point.




      Pretend that you don't have tinnitus, and you're in a subway in New York
      jammed in like sardines, and some idiot comes up behind you, and starts
      jabbing you in the back with an umbrella. What happens?




      Well, if you're normal, you get upset, and you get mad. Your face gets
      red, your blood pressure goes up, and your pulse goes up. Those are
      physical changes in you based on the thought of the jerk who's stabbing
      you in the back with an umbrella. You turn around to tell him to stop, and
      you discover that it's not an umbrella, it's a gun. What happens?




      Your face goes pale, your palms get moist, your mouth gets dry. Those are
      physical changes in you based upon your thoughts about the stimulus - the
      very same stimulus, a poke in the back. So you turn around to give the guy
      all your money and you discover that it is not a gun. It's a blind lady
      with a cane trying to maintain her balance in this precarious situation.
      What happens?




      The colour returns to your face, a shudder of compassion comes over you,
      maybe a tear comes to your eyes. You try to assist her to a safe place in
      the subway. Again a different set of physical findings based upon your
      thoughts about the stimulus. So what's our stimulus? Our stimulus is our
      tinnitus. Changing the thoughts that we have about our tinnitus can not
      only impact on us philosophically, it can impact on us physically.




      Another example of your thoughts determining your emotional reaction to a
      situation is to imagine that three people were retrenched from their jobs.




      The first person thinks 'I am a Failure' , their emotional reaction is one
      of despair, anger, frustration and depression.




      The second person's thoughts are neutral, they therefore have no emotional
      reaction.


      The third person's thoughts are positive, 'I will take my payout and start
      that small business I have always wanted' , their emotional reaction is
      one of joy, hope, excitement and happiness.




      Each person was faced with the same situation, but because each person
      perceived their situation in a different way, they had a different
      emotional reaction.




      When you apply this philosophy to our situation of having tinnitus.....




      If your perception is negative, your emotional reaction will be one of
      despair, anxiety and depression. If your perception is neutral, 'It is
      difficult but I can cope' , you will have no emotional response.




      However if your perception is positive, 'I will manage it and not let it
      affect my life', your emotional reaction will be one of control, optimism
      and acceptance



       

      When a sound is threatening or unknown, the subconscious mind puts the
      brain and body into the 'fight or flight' survival mode.




      The following story from a paper presented by Dr. Stephen Nagler at a
      tinnitus seminar illustrates why a negative perception of tinnitus causes
      so much anxiety:




      (Dr. Nagler is a past Chairman of the Board of Directors of the American
      Tinnitus Association and for seven years served on ATA's Scientific
      Advisory Committee)




      There is a travelling salesman making several stops during a cold winter.
      He is chilly, tired, and hungry, but he has forgotten to make a motel
      reservation. He sees a motel by the side of the road. One level.




      Park right outside your room. Vacancy light flashing. The manager says
      that there is one room left, but unfortunately the steam radiator has a
      small crack in it; there is a constant 'hsssss' sound as steam escapes.




      The salesman is cold, tired and hungry, and takes the room gratefully. He
      enters the room, notices the quiet 'hsssss' sound and puts down his bags,
      eats a sandwich, brushes his teeth, takes a nice hot shower, puts on his
      pyjamas, pulls back the fresh linen on the bed, crawls in, and falls
      asleep.




      The next morning he awakes refreshed, and goes on his way. Six weeks later
      he finds himself in the same situation. Same town. Cold, tired, hungry. No
      reservation. He remembers the motel. The manager says, 'I have one room
      left. It's the same room you had six weeks ago, and I apologise: I have
      not yet had a chance to fix the steam radiator.' The salesman says 'No
      problem. I slept just great six weeks ago. I'll take it'.




      As he is walking down towards the room, the hotel manager yells to him,
      'Oh yes, one other thing. A couple of days ago a travelling circus came
      through our small town here, and two cobras escaped from the snake
      charmer. They caught one of them right there - about twenty yards up the
      street. And they expect to catch the other one any time now. Thought you'd
      like to know. Have a good night's sleep'.




      The salesman enters his room. He hears it. 'Hsssss' He looks carefully
      behind the curtain. Then he gets ready for that nice hot shower, but he
      slowly peeks into the shower before taking a quick shower. He then gets
      ready for bed. He looks under the bed first. He pulls down those fresh
      sheets rather cautiously before he slides in - somewhat tentatively.




      Do you think he sleeps? Not a wink! He tosses and turns all night, cannot
      wait to leave at daybreak, even before. As he leaves the motel, the
      manager sees him. 'Hi. Glad I caught you. I got a phone call around 2a.m.
      An eighteen wheeler ran over the second cobra about two miles up the road.
      Just thought you'd like to know.'




      Six weeks ago, the 'hsssss' of the cracked steam radiator was a
      meaningless neutral background sound, which quickly 'faded away' and
      afforded the salesman a pleasant restful sleep. Now, the exact same sound
      - same frequency, same intensity, same character - was the most intrusive,
      most annoying sound imaginable - only because it had taken on a new
      meaning. But was it really louder?




      It certainly seemed so to the salesman - even though the readings on a
      decibel metre placed in the room would have been identical. And since
      people who are afflicted with (subjective) tinnitus are the only people
      who can hear their tinnitus... perceived loudness is the only loudness
      that counts.




      Perceived loudness is a function of two variables - the magnitude of the
      signal... and the meaning assigned to that signal.
